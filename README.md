# Breast-Cancer-DDSM-Detection-Using-ResNet

# Abstract
Early detection of breast cancer and it’s correct identification can go a long way in not only
saving a woman’s life but also her quality of life. The identification of breast cancer depends
on biomedical images such as mammography scans and histopathological slides which are ob-
tained from biopsies. Analysing these images require specialists in the oncology domain, and
there can be times of uncertainty and differences of opinion among experts. Computer aided
diagnostic techniques step in to resolve such a problem. The use of Deep Learning in the field
of radiology has shown great promise in improving early and accurate cancer detection.
Breast Cancer Detection using various Deep Learning algorithms by using mammographic
scans and histopathological slides have been carried out by researchers in this domain. This
study aims to compare the performance of ResNet of 3 different depths (a Convolutional Neural
Network) trained from scratch for the task of classifying benign and malignant histopathological
images. Kaiming initialization of weights was implemented and the final layer was replaced
with a fully connected network with softmax activation.
